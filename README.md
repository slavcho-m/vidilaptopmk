# 🏗️ Project Root

Welcome to the **root of the project repository**!  
This repository is organized into two main sections:

- **🖥️ `frontend/`** — Contains the complete **frontend application**, built and initialized using **React** (with TypeScript and modern tooling).  
- **⚙️ `backend/`** — Houses all **microservices**, each within its own dedicated folder, independently initialized as a **Spring Boot** project.

This structure keeps the frontend and backend cleanly separated while maintaining a unified project workspace. 🚀
